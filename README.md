Migrating edmx to Fluent API syntax

The idea here is that user input with:

1. Source path of edmx file
2. Output path to generate fluent mapping files for Entity Framework.

Console Application is based on [articles](https://anton-dambrouski.medium.com/how-to-migrate-from-entity-framework-edmx-files-to-fluent-api-syntax-part-1-1-2-f53e31fd0b57) from Anton Dambrouski. This is part 1, for example.
